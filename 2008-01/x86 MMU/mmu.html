<h1 align="center"><b>THE MMU</b></h1><br>
<p align="justify"><b>
Some years back ,while i was reading a quite recent book in operating system development,
i found some information about memory management in operating system design and how its
done out there with some specific operating systems,being it hobby or professionnal.
I read something like "...the kernel is loaded in the upper 4GB of address space".
I also saw weird memory addresses wich were 32 bits.At that time,i knew that most computers
could have a maximum of 512 Mb of memory onboard.I thus asked myself:How it possible
to access memory above the gigabyte when you only have say 128Mb onboard.Weird thing with yet,
a simple answer:the MMU is the guy behind this "Mafia".
<br>
<p align="justify">
The MMU stands for Memory Management Unit,also sometimes called Paged Memory Management Unit.
It is  computer hardware component responsible for memory access handling by the CPU.
Its function depends on the type is system and type of CPU:
<ul>
<li>Virtual to physical address translation (virtual memory management)<br>This will usually be found on
big cpus such as i386 based processors and others.</li>
<li>Memory Protection</li>
<li>Cache Control /Bus Arbitration.<br>
This will be found on cpus having a cache for cache control and bus arbitration will be found in multiprocessor systems
or single processors with multicore.That is when cpu cores share the same physical memory package.
</li>
<li>
Bank switching ,that you will usually find in small 8 bit microprocessor systems such as the NES( i wrote an emulator for it).
</li>
<br>
</ul>
The mmu can reside in the same IC package as the CPU (thats the case is major 32 bit cpus)
or could be external to the CPU IC package.
</p>
<p align="justify">
As the major and most important in our context use for the MMU is for virtual memory management,well will not disgress further in
its other uses and concentrate on the topic.<br>
To achieve its goal of address translation,the MMU divides the address (virtual) in little fields that will permit the location of
data in memory.The entire virtual address space is divided in little chuncks of memory called pages.
For those who are lost,a virtual address is the address the cpu 'sees and sends' to the MMU.The mmu will then translate this in a physical
memory address.This is depicted in the figure below.<br>

<br>
As said above ,the linear  address space is divided in little field.The upper bits are used to point to a page
 an offset in a page.<br>
 <center><img src="images/paging_mechanism.jpg" alt="this is the layout for page setup"></center>
 <br>
 Each page directory is an array of page directory entries.Each directory entry contains the base physical address
 of a page table,i.e the physical start address of the page directory.It also contains attributes of the page table,the
 most commons being a flag to indicate if the page is present in memory,read only,system or user page table.
 <br><center><img src="images/pde_structure.jpg" alt="page directory entry"></center><br>
 The page table is an array of page table entries.Each page table entry contains the base address of a table,that is the
 address (physical) of the first byte of a table.Also,it contains attributes that are quite similar to the ones in the
 page directory entries.
 <br><center><img src="images/pte_structure.jpg" alt="page table entry"></center><br>
 So to resume,the page directory contains contains entries that tells us where the page tables of a programm are located in main memory,
 the page table tells us where the pages uses by this program are located in memory.All of this excluding their properties such as
 the page being present in main memory or not and others.
 The main purpose for keeping track of which pages are not in main memory is to simulate the existence of much more physical memory than
 whats present on the system.When the CPU tries to access a memory location in a page thats not in main memory,the MMU will generate a
 page fault.A page fault is an exception indicating that a page is not present in main memory.
 So a system with 128 Mb of ram could use this mechanism to increase its memory capacity to say 1GB if we suppose there is a secondary storage device such as a harddisk which can provide us with 1Gb-128Mb of disk space.When a page fault occurs,the CPU invokes a programmer defined routine
usually called the page fault handler that does the necessary routines to bring the missing page in main memory,by say sending and unused page in
secondary memory.The operation of moving an unused page to secondary memory is called swapping,and the file where the unused pages are stored is usually called the pagefile of swapfile.
I willl take here a concrete example of how all of this works.Some people with some experience will sort out that my system is feasible,
but non economic.My hypothetical system will consist of a cpu weith a mmu.The cpu will have a 16 bit address bus(yeah too small so non economic as i said above,just for simplicity).This address will be divided as follows :
<ul>
<li>The directory field will be 4 bit wide so will have a max of 16 entriees.</li>
<li>The Table field will also be 4 bits,so 16 entries max also.</li>
<li>The offset field is 8 bits wide so each page will have 256bytes</li>
</ul>
<center><img src="images/example_address.jpg" alt="image of 16 bit adress field"></center>
<br>
We will now suppose that the cpu has output address 0xFAAA on its address bus.
All addresses are in hexadecimal.
Since the upper 4 bits of the address are used to point to the page directory entry,it will point in this case to entry 0xF,i.e the topmost
entry in the page directory.
Lets further suppose that each of the entries in the page directory is of this format.
<br>
<center><img src="images/example_pde_structure.jpg" alt="entry structure for example"><br></center>
Lets again suppose that in our case entry 0xF contains 0xA002.0xA00 i.e the three first bytes gives us the physical base address of
the page table being used at the moment.Lets not care about the attribute bits for now.
Taking another look at our first address from the CPU,we see that the directory field wich is 4 bits in our case is 0xA ,i.e 10 in decimal.
This means that entry 10 in our page table,the page table being located at address 0xA000 as we saw above,contains the address of the first bytes
of the page where our information is located.
Now lets suppose (again!!)that our page table entries have the format below.
<br><img src="images/example_pte_structure.jpg" alt="page table entry structure"><br>
In our case we will suppose(again,sorry) that our entry number 10 contains  0xCB1A.
This means the physical base address of our page being accessed is 0xCB1 or 0x0CB1.
Our offset into the page in this case,looking again at our cpu address 0xFAAA is 0xAA
so our physical address the MMU sends to the memory chip is 0xCB1 + 0x00AA = 0x0D5B.
So the virtual address 0xFAAA "becomes" the physical address 0x0D5B.
All of this is supposing the page is present in memory,that is the present flag is set.
If it were not then a pagefault exception would have generated and software would have been invoked to take appropriate
actions to move the page from the pagefile to main memory.
Many algorithms out there have been designed for that such as the LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm.

My hopes are that this tutorial has not been long and boring and that many people gained something
when reading this.There are surely mistakes in this document,so don't blame me if your dog reads this
and still fails his A+ certification exams.
Thanks to all.
